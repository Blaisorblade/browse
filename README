Browsable Scala source code in HTML with:
- syntax highlighting
- types/applied implicits in tooltips
- references/definition highlighted on mouseover
- links to definition

Still in development.  Bugs are features and features are accidental.

To build with sbt (http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup):

$ sbt
> package

This produces a compiler plugin in target/.

Usage

Add the following options to your compile command for your project:
  -Xplugin:<path-to-browse>/browse-0.1.jar
  -P:browse:base-directory:<src-dir>

If you are using sbt, substitute the location of the browse jar in the following:

  val browseJarPath =  "<path-to-browse>/browse-0.1.jar"
  override def compileOptions =
    CompileOption("-Xplugin:" + browseJarPath) ::
    CompileOption("-P:browse:base-directory:" + mainScalaSourcePath.asFile.getAbsolutePath) ::
    super.compileOptions.toList

You will get a directory 'browse' that mirrors the directory structure of your sources relative
to the specified base directory with one HTML file for each source file.  You can make simple
changes to the syntax highlighting in the style.css file in the root output directory.  The linked.js
file implements the highlighting of refererences.
