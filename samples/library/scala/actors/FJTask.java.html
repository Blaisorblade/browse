<span class="comment">/**
 * Abstract base class for Fork/Join Tasks.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * FJTasks are lightweight, stripped-down analogs of Threads. 
 * Many FJTasks share the same pool of Java threads. This is
 * supported by the FJTaskRunnerGroup and FJTaskRunner classes, that 
 * mainly contain
 * methods called only internally by FJTasks.
 * FJTasks support versions of the most common methods found in class Thread,
 * including start(), yield() and join(). However, they
 * don't support priorities, ThreadGroups or other bookkeeping
 * or control methods of class Thread.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * FJTasks should normally be defined by subclassing and adding a run() method.
 * Alternatively, static inner class &lt;code&gt;Wrap(Runnable r)&lt;/code&gt; 
 * can be used to
 * wrap an existing Runnable object in a FJTask. 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;code&gt;FJTaskRunnerGroup.execute(FJTask)&lt;/code&gt; can be used to
 * initiate a FJTask from a non-FJTask thread. 
 * And &lt;code&gt;FJTaskRunnerGroup.invoke(FJTask)&lt;/code&gt; can be used to initiate
 * a FJTask and then wait for it to complete before returning.
 * These are the only entry-points from normal threads to FJTasks.
 * Most FJTask methods themselves may only be called from within running FJTasks.
 * They throw ClassCastExceptions if they are not, 
 * reflecting the fact that these methods
 * can only be executed using FJTaskRunner threads, not generic
 * java.lang.Threads.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are three different ways to run a FJTask,
 * with different scheduling semantics:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt; FJTask.start() (as well as FJTaskRunnerGroup.execute(FJTask)) 
 *         behaves pretty much like Thread.start(). It enqueues a task to be
 *         run the next time any FJTaskRunner thread is otherwise idle.
 *         It maintains standard FIFO ordering with respect to
 *         the group of worker threads.
 *   &lt;li&gt; FJTask.fork() (as well as the two-task spawning method,
 *         coInvoke(task1, task2), and the array version 
 *         coInvoke(FJTask[] tasks)) starts a task 
 *         that will be executed in
 *         procedure-call-like LIFO order if executed by the 
 *         same worker thread as the one that created it, but is FIFO 
 *         with respect to other tasks if it is run by
 *         other worker threads. That is, earlier-forked
 *         tasks are preferred to later-forked tasks by other idle workers.
 *         Fork() is noticeably faster than start(), but can only be
 *         used when these scheduling semantics are acceptable.
 *   &lt;li&gt; FJTask.invoke(FJTask) just executes the run method
 *        of one task from within another. It is the analog of a
 *        direct call.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The main economies of FJTasks stem from the fact that
 * FJTasks do not support blocking operations of any kind. 
 * FJTasks should just run to completion without
 * issuing waits or performing blocking IO. 
 * There are several styles for creating the run methods that
 * execute as tasks, including
 * event-style methods, and pure computational methods.
 * Generally, the best kinds of FJTasks are those that in turn
 * generate other FJTasks. 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There is nothing actually
 * preventing you from blocking within a FJTask, and very short waits/blocks are
 * completely well behaved. But FJTasks are not designed
 * to support arbitrary synchronization 
 * since there is no way to suspend and resume individual tasks
 * once they have begun executing. FJTasks should also be finite
 * in duration -- they should not contain infinite loops.
 * FJTasks that might need to perform a blocking
 * action, or hold locks for extended periods, or 
 * loop forever can instead create normal 
 * java Thread objects that will do so. FJTasks are just not
 * designed to support these things. 
 * FJTasks may however yield() control to allow their FJTaskRunner threads
 * to run other tasks,
 * and may wait for other dependent tasks via join(). These
 * are the only coordination mechanisms supported by FJTasks.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * FJTasks, and the FJTaskRunners that execute them are not
 * intrinsically robust with respect to exceptions. 
 * A FJTask that aborts via an exception does not automatically
 * have its completion flag (isDone) set. 
 * As with ordinary Threads, an uncaught exception will normally cause
 * its FJTaskRunner thread to die, which in turn may sometimes
 * cause other computations being performed to hang or abort.
 * You can of course
 * do better by trapping exceptions inside the run methods of FJTasks.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The overhead differences between FJTasks and Threads are substantial,
 * especially when using fork() or coInvoke().
 * FJTasks can be two or three orders of magnitude faster than Threads,
 * at least when run on JVMs with high-performance garbage collection
 * (every FJTask quickly becomes garbage) and good native thread support.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Given these overhead savings, you might be tempted to use FJTasks for 
 * everything you would use a normal Thread to do. Don't. Java Threads
 * remain better for general purpose thread-based programming. Remember
 * that FJTasks cannot be used for designs involving arbitrary blocking 
 * synchronization or I/O. Extending FJTasks to support such capabilities
 * would amount to re-inventing the Thread class, and would make them
 * less optimal in the contexts that they were designed for.
